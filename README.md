# Transfer-Learning-Image-Classification-VGG16

Used transfer learning by training a classifier on top of VGG16, a popular, former state-of-the-art convolutional neural network that was trained on the ImageNet data set.  After building classifier, trained this Python model written in Tensorflow on the Tensorflow flower data set.  Utilized Titan X Pascal GPU to accelerate training and achieved an accuracy rate of 90.74%.
